# diff

diff and merge utility written in pure Python (ver > 3.2)

### Aim

You guessed it - its not fast, then why re-invent the wheel?

Because I think traditional diff tools produce beautiful output, and this project aims to be the end-all-be-all *text*

 - diff
 - merge
 - merge conflict resolver
